## Tool Skills

The `skills/` directory contains one subdirectory per third-party platform, each with a `SKILL.md` file. Each skill describes the platform, its data model, the specific API operations available to agents, and declares the required env vars in its frontmatter `metadata` field. Agents reference skills through their `TOOLS.md` file.

All skills draw credentials from `~/.openclaw/.env` on the daemon host. `.env.example` is the committed sample template — it contains non-functional placeholder values and documents every variable name and format expected by the skills.

| Skill | Description |
|---|---|
| `banner` | Ellucian Banner SIS — lets an agent query student academic records, registration, financial aid awards, and employee HR data via Banner REST APIs. |
| `blackbaud-raisers-edge` | Blackbaud Raiser's Edge NXT — lets an agent query alumni constituent records, giving history, pledge tracking, and wealth screening scores for advancement workflows. |
| `canvas` | Instructure Canvas LMS — lets an agent read and write course content, assignments, grades, and engagement analytics. |
| `civitas-learning` | Civitas Learning analytics platform — lets an agent retrieve student risk scores, graduation probability, course success predictions, and intervention outcome tracking. |
| `eab-navigate` | EAB Navigate student success platform — lets an agent manage early alerts, advising appointments, four-year plans, and at-risk cohort outreach. |
| `handshake` | Handshake career platform — lets an agent search jobs and internships, retrieve employer profiles, and surface career fair registrations for students. |
| `salesforce-education-cloud` | Salesforce Education Cloud and NPSP — lets an agent query and update enrollment CRM records, alumni giving history, campaign membership, and engagement scores. |
| `servicenow` | ServiceNow ITSM — lets an agent create, update, and resolve IT incidents, search the knowledge base, and check campus service status. |
| `slate` | Technolutions Slate CRM — lets an agent read and write prospect, applicant, and admitted-student records and trigger enrollment communication workflows. |
| `workday` | Workday HCM and Workday Student — lets an agent retrieve employee records, student financial aid awards, and initiate HR self-service workflows. |

## NemoClaw Import Instructions

1. **Copy this directory's contents** into `/sandbox/.openclaw/` on the NemoClaw sandbox:

   ```bash
   cp -r higher-education/. /sandbox/.openclaw/
   ```

2. **Set ownership** so the sandbox user can read all agent workspace files:

   ```bash
   chown -R sandbox:sandbox /sandbox/.openclaw/agents/
   ```

3. **Replace sample credentials** in every `auth-profiles.json`. Each file contains a clearly marked placeholder key. Replace with your actual Anthropic API key (and any other provider keys you add):

   ```bash
   find /sandbox/.openclaw/agents -name auth-profiles.json
   # Edit each file and replace the placeholder apiKey value
   ```

4. **Set up third-party platform credentials** by copying the sample template to `~/.openclaw/.env` and filling in real API keys for each integration your deployment uses:

   ```bash
   cp /sandbox/.openclaw/.env.example ~/.openclaw/.env
   # Edit ~/.openclaw/.env and replace every SAMPLE-replace-me-* value
   ```

   Leave any variables for platforms you are not using set to their placeholder values — skills only attempt connections when an agent explicitly invokes them.

5. **Recompute the config hash** after any edits to `openclaw.json`:

   ```bash
   cd /sandbox/.openclaw
   shasum -a 256 openclaw.json > .config-hash
   ```

6. **Reload the OpenClaw gateway** to pick up the new configuration:

   ```bash
   openclaw reload
   # or restart the gateway service per your deployment method
   ```

## Entry Point

The default agent — `higher-education-assistant` (Campus Assistant) — is the segment entry point. All incoming conversations route through it. It uses `sessions_spawn` to delegate to specialist subagents and synthesizes their responses before returning to the user. The routing logic is defined in `agents/higher-education-assistant/agent/AGENTS.md`.

## Notes

- Model selection and instance configuration for all agents live in `openclaw.json`. To change the model or session settings for a specific agent, update its object in `openclaw.json` and recompute `.config-hash`.
- The `workspace/` directory at `/sandbox/.openclaw/workspace/` is shared across all agents in a conversation thread. The parent agent uses it for multi-step, multi-agent coordination context.
- `auth-profiles.json` credentials are host-only and never exposed to model inference.
