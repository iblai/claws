# Financial Services — OpenClaw Segment Configuration

This directory is a complete, drop-in OpenClaw configuration for the **Financial Services** solution segment. It contains one parent orchestrator agent and twelve specialist subagents covering the full range of a financial services firm's operational and compliance needs.

## Architecture

The **Advisory Assistant** (`financial-services-assistant`) is the default entry point. It greets staff, interprets intent, and delegates to the appropriate specialist subagent via `sessions_spawn`. Subagents are domain experts that return structured results to the Advisory Assistant for synthesis.

## OpenClaw Import Instructions

### Prerequisites

- A running OpenClaw/NemoClaw instance with the OpenClaw gateway configured.
- The sandbox user has write access to `/sandbox/.openclaw/`.
- You have valid Anthropic API credentials to replace the sample placeholders.

### Steps

**1. Copy the configuration into the sandbox.**

```bash
cp -r financial-services/. /sandbox/.openclaw/
```

**2. Verify directory ownership.**

All files under `/sandbox/.openclaw/agents/` must be owned by the sandbox user:

```bash
chown -R sandbox:sandbox /sandbox/.openclaw/agents/
```

**3. Set third-party platform credentials.**

Copy the sample env template to the OpenClaw daemon env file and fill in real API keys for every platform your deployment uses:

```bash
cp /sandbox/.openclaw/.env.example ~/.openclaw/.env
vi ~/.openclaw/.env
```

The OpenClaw daemon reads credentials from `~/.openclaw/.env` at startup. The `.env.example` file documents all required variables grouped by skill.

**4. Replace Anthropic inference credentials.**

Every `agents/<agent-id>/agent/auth-profiles.json` contains a non-functional placeholder API key. Replace the `apiKey` value in each file with a real Anthropic API key (or the appropriate credential for your inference routing setup) before starting the gateway:

```bash
# Example — repeat for all 13 agent directories
vi /sandbox/.openclaw/agents/financial-services-assistant/agent/auth-profiles.json
```

**5. Recompute the config hash.**

After any edit to `openclaw.json`, regenerate `.config-hash`:

```bash
cd /sandbox/.openclaw && shasum -a 256 openclaw.json > .config-hash
```

**6. Reload the OpenClaw gateway.**

```bash
openclaw reload
# or
systemctl restart openclaw
```

The `financial-services-assistant` agent is declared as `"default": true` in `openclaw.json` and will be the entry point for all new sessions.

## Tool Skills

The `skills/` directory contains one subdirectory per third-party platform, each with a `SKILL.md` file. Each skill describes the platform, its relevant capabilities, the exact API operations agents may call, and declares the required env vars in its `metadata` frontmatter key. Agents reference these skills at runtime to know how to interact with external systems.

All skills draw credentials from `~/.openclaw/.env` on the OpenClaw host. The committed `.env.example` is the sample template — it contains non-functional placeholder values only and is safe to check in. Copy it to `~/.openclaw/.env` and fill in real keys before deploying.

## Important Notes

- **No investment advice**: All agents are configured to support licensed advisors and compliance officers — they do not independently provide individualized financial advice to end clients.
- **Audit trails**: Every agent is configured to log key actions to `/sandbox/.openclaw/workspace/` for examination readiness.
- **Human escalation**: Each agent's SOUL.md includes explicit escalation rules for situations requiring a human supervisor, CCO, BSA Officer, or CISO.
- **Credentials**: The `auth-profiles.json` files contain sample placeholders only. They are clearly marked and must be replaced before any production use.
